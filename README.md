Newton_Lagrange_Interpolation
	- Newtonâ€™s divided differences interpolation polynomial. For any finite set
		of data points there is only one polynomial that passes through all the
		points.

	- Lagrange Interpolation constructs a polynomial P(x) of degree <= (n-1) that
		passes through all the points (n is the total number of interpolation points)  


Cubic_Interpolation
	- The cubic spline is constructed of piecewise third-order polynomials which
		passes through all the given points


Composite_Rules
	-	Given a definite integral, approximate the the integral with by using the
		Trapezoidal, Simpson, and Gaussian Quadrature Rules.

	- Use Adaptive Quadrature approach to approximate the integrals f(x)=sin(1/x)
		and g(x)=cos(1/x) over [0.1, 2]
